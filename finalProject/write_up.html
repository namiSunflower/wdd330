        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This app is a choose-your-own adventure type of game. It's based on Pokemon and is a casual text adventure game that can be enjoyed by many!</p>
    
        <h3>Directions on How to Use App:</h3>
        <p>The app is very user-friendly as players only need to read the text and choose the options they want to determine the game's ending. They simply have to choose what they want by clicking a specific option.</p>

        <h3>A list of Itemized CSS featuresÂ used:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The layout for mobile phones</li>
            <li>The layout for larger screens</li>
            <li>Hover effect</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Design Process Description:</h3>
        <p>I decided to keep it very simple since I'm not very good with designing websites. I wanted to keep it very user-friendly as much as possible.</p>

        <h3>Did you alter your app from the original concept? How did you and why?</h3>
        <p>Yes, I made changes to it since initially, I was very ambitious with the project. I wanted there to be a main menu and a sophisticated achievements system. I was also originally envisioning an app with animations as well, but I decided not to do it since they were also quite complicated to add.</p>

        <h3>What problems did you have and how did you resolve them</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest problem would have to be figuring out how I can store all the Pokemon encountered and captured by the user. I also had issues with displaying images. Those were my biggest problems. I've decided to create multiple arrays and objects and storing them consistently in local storage. It might not be the best solution, but it's what helped make most things work.

        <h3>Describe your use of the coding topics from the course. How were they applied?</h3>
        <p>I learned the most on how I can async functions and fetching API. Before, I was terrified at the thought of fetching API especially when dealing with nested JSON files. That was the topic I've benefitted the most in my learning journey. I also applied the concept of using localStorage and setting keys and values extensively in my app.</p>
