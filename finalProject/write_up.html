        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This is a simple choose-your-own adventure type of game. It's based on Pokemon and can be enjoyed by people of any age.</p>
    
        <h3>Directions on How to Use App:</h3>
        <p>The app is very user-friendly as players only need to read the text and choose the options they want to determine the game's ending. They simply have to choose what they want by clicking a button displaying text about a choice.</p>

        <h3>A list of Itemized CSS featuresÂ used:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The layout for mobile phones</li>
            <li>The layout for larger screens</li>
            <li>Hover effect</li>
            <li>Minimalist design</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Design Process Description:</h3>
        <p>I decided to keep it very simple since I'm not very good with designing websites. I wanted to keep it very user-friendly with a minimalist design as much as possible.</p>

        <h3>Did you alter your app from the original concept? How did you and why?</h3>
        <p>Yes, to be honest, I lost the original code to my app a day ago. I was trying to tinker with Github and the terminal and accidentally deleted my original code permanently I made changes to it. I'm not very satisfied with the outcome, but it's all I've managed to salvage in a day. I decided to make a lot of changes to make up for the limited time and focus more on the choose-your-own story aspect. Although, initially, I was also very ambitious with the project. I wanted there to be a main menu and a sophisticated achievements system. I was also originally envisioning an app with animations as well, but I decided not to do it since they were also quite complicated to add. Too bad I wasn't able to fulfill what I had in mind, but I plan to continue working on the project to add on my resume even after the semester ends.</p>

        <h3>What problems did you have and how did you resolve them</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest problem was when I had lost my original code. I've made so much progress there compared to what I have now. But, I decided to simplify my idea after the incident. I learned my lesson the hard way to always have a back-up for the code aside from Github. 
        </p>


        <h3>Describe your use of the coding topics from the course. How were they applied?</h3>
        <p>Prior to losing the code, I learned the most on how I can async functions and fetching API. Before, I was terrified at the thought of fetching API especially when dealing with nested JSON files. That was the topic I've benefitted the most in my learning journey. I also applied the concept of using localStorage and setting keys and values extensively in my app. I also became more comfortable in using higher-order functions and arrow functions because of this course. I've applied those concepts a bit in my project too. I would've loved to have more time fixing the organization of my code as well.</p>
