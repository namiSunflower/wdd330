        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>My app idea is to create a text-based adventure game using the Pokemon API. The player will be presented with different options in the story, and the ending will depend based on their choices. 
          The purpose of this app is more of a way to challenge my skills and to apply what I have learned throughout this course. The main purpose of the app is for entertainment and enjoyment. I want players to
        experience the same joy I feel whenever I play choose-your-own-adventure text-based story games as I have found more and more people are losing interest to read.</p>
      
        <h3>Audience:</h3>
        <p>My target audience is for people who enjoy playing the original Pokemon RPG's. However, it's not just exclusive to them as people who are unfamiliar with pokemon are more than welcomed to play it.
          Another primary target for me is the people who might not enjoy reading for leisure or have attention-span problems while reading. I am hoping my app can help those people appreciate the joy of reading and being in control of the story.
          I also have no set target age-range for my app.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Sources:</h3>
        <h4>External API</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>localStorage</h4>
        <p>I plan to use localStorage as a way to save user's progress such as how far they are into the story and the choices they've made. I also plan to use this as a way to store the pokemon they've encountered throughout the story.</p>
        <h4>local JSON file</h4>
        <p>I'm planning to use a local JSON file as well to use as a reference for the starter pokemon the user will choose from.</p>
